# Errata for *Neural Networks and Deep Learning: A Textbook*

This repository contains (unofficial) [errata](errata.md) for the book [*Neural Networks and
Deep Learning: A Textbook*](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319944623),
 Charu C. Aggarwal, Springer, 2018. .

Since GitHub does not render LaTeX (equations), a PDF rendered from the
errata MarkDown will be available for easier use. The latest version is
available [here](NNDL-Errata-08-June-2020.pdf).
